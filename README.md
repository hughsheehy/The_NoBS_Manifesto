# The No BS Manifesto

Axioms
	
	Axiom #1: Manifestos are only reminders
	
	Axiom #2: There is no substitute for thinking
	
	Axiom #3: Being able to do it is what matters
	
	Axiom #4: Straight talk saves lives
	
	Axiom #5: Five axioms is two too many


Principles
	
	1. No jargon is allowed
	
	2. The measure of team success is overall business success
	
	3. Trade offs always exist. Make them explicit. Use dollars to decide. 
	
	4. Modularization is good. Simpler is better. Complex is bad. 
	
	5. Write stuff down. Write it so people can understand it.
	
	6. Data and numbers matter. Don't ignore your gut but don't trust it. 
	
	7. Work inside the business (e.g. software development) must aim to achieve something in the real world.
	
	8. No platitudes, obvious truths or vague approximations allowed.
	
	9. Listen more than you talk. Ask for specific things.
	
	10. Do what you promised. Admit early if thereâ€™s a problem.
	
	11. Make big decisions carefully. Make small decisions quickly. Get on with it.
	
	12. Make the world a better place. Inside the team and outside. 
	
	13. The specific tech you use rarely matters. Use what works, not what you like.
